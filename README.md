# TrumpBot

This project is part of my continutation of my exploration and interest in NLP. I have leveraged the GTP-2 model from OpenAI to create a model that can write Trump's rally speeches.

This repository contains:
1. the notebook used to train the model
2. a poster that contains more details on the project
